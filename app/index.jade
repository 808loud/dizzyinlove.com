        h4 How we met
        p Liz and David both went to the University of St. Thomas, and majored in Journalism. They both graduated in the class of 2010. You'd think that this was where they met, but surprisingly they never met in college.
        p It wasn't until May 10th, 2012, that the two first met through a mutual friend.
        p They bonded quickly, and starting in September, they began talking freqently.

        h4 Our first date
        p On December 13, 2012, Liz bravely attended David's company party as his +1. You would think this would be their first date. But Liz is adamant to this day that this was not the case. I guess it doesn't count if it's free food and drinks &hellip;
        p On January 4th, 2013, they went on their first real date at La Grolla in St. Paul.
